The difference in RTT values could be influenced by various factors,
such as physical distance, network traffic, and routing quality.

1. ***www.oslomet.no***
   Minimum = 17ms, Maximum = 38ms, Average = 20ms

   The received minimum RTT value of 17ms indicates effective
   communication with the source. The maximum RTT value of 38ms
   suggests less effective communication, likely caused by high
   network load. Since the location is in Norway, this shouldn't
   be due to geographical distance. The average RTT of 20ms
   indicates good overall performance.

2. ***www.ox.ac.uk***
   Minimum = 16ms, Maximum = 23ms, Average = 20ms

   The received minimum RTT value of 16ms indicates effective
   communication with the source. The maximum RTT value of 23ms,
   although less effective, is still reasonable and may be
   influenced by geographical distance. The average RTT of 20ms
   indicates good average performance.

4. ***www.sydney.edu.au***
   Minimum = 16ms, Maximum = 28ms, Average = 19ms

   The received minimum RTT value of 16ms indicates effective
   communication with the source. The maximum RTT value of 28ms,
   likely influenced by geographical distance, suggests less effective
   communication. The average RTT of 19ms indicates good average
   performance.
